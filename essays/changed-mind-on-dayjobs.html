      <h1>How I've changed my mind on day jobs</h1>
      <small class="post-date">October 23, 2019</small>
      <p>I used to be staunchly against day jobs.</p>
      <p>
        The idea of a filler job that consumes 40+ of your 168 hours per week
        seemed like a soul-sucking, depressing waste of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hypocritically, I’ve pretty much always had them, bar two extended
        periods of trying solely creative and business projects.
      </p>
      <p>The thing about day jobs is that they’re primal.</p>
      <p>
        If you trace far back enough through our ancestors, hunting was their
        day job. So was building shelter and protecting their family.
      </p>
      <p>
        They didn’t get to be choosy about being a poet instead of a hunter.
        Either they hunted or they died.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even after some time had passed, they pretty much took whatever job they
        could get to eat and take care of their family or tribe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The beautiful thing about today is that we’re no longer forced to pick
        just any day job.
      </p>
      <p>
        But we’ve also taken it so far as to&nbsp;<em>expect</em> that we can
        either get our dream job&nbsp;<em>now</em>, or do nothing at all.
      </p>
      <p>If it’s not the absolute best, it’s not worth our time.</p>
      <p>
        Except…if you actually act on this mentality and quit whatever job you
        have in the hopes of replacing it with your dream job or business,
        you’ll either be fortunate and succeed, or very commonly, you’ll be
        faced with the reality of the scarcity of your resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is how I thought every time I quit a job to pursue my creative or
        entrepreneurial work.
      </p>
      <p>
        And it wasn’t even that extreme. I didn’t want the perfect job or work,
        I just wanted work that I was fully in control of and that was better
        than what I was doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each time I did that, I would be invigorated for a while, and then
        realize I was trying to force my dreams and necessity for money to
        coalesce into the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        This usually meant compromising on one or the other. My work would
        suffer in order to try to make money, and my income would suffer because
        I insisted on doing “my passion”.
      </p>
      <p>So now, I’m pursuing a day job.</p>
      <p>
        Granted, I’m pursuing one that I’m actually excited about and that I
        hope to make into a career. But it’s still a job.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if it doesn’t work out, I’ll get whatever job I can find to pay the
        bills.
      </p>
      <p>
        But…even though we need to embrace work that pays our bills as our
        lowest bar, we definitely shouldn’t stop there.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would never be satisfied settling for a mediocre job in the long-term.
        I’d like to avoid it in the short-term too, but if I can’t, so be it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference between me getting a job now and when I had jobs that I
        complained about and was miserable in, is that now I’m embracing it as a
        privilege.
      </p>
      <p>
        The luxury we have to pick from a smorgasbord of possible work is truly
        amazing, and the work that we&nbsp;choose&nbsp;is a reward in and of
        itself in that we actually get to <em>choose</em> it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, we can go all out on our passions. And if we’re lucky,
        eventually we can&nbsp;<em>build</em> our way into our passions making
        us a living. But going directly for that goal is seeming less and less
        like the optimal solution.

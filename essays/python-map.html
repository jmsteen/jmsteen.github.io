      What's the fastest way to map a list of values in Python?
    </h1>
    <p>
      I was curious what the fastest way is to map a list of values in Python,
      so I decided to run a little experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It turns out that when Elon finally gets to Mars, he decides to create a
      new temperature scale that betters reflects the colder median temperature
      there.
    </p>
    <p>It's measured in Musk degrees (°M).</p>
    <p>
      We have a list of Mars temperature measurements in Fahrenheit, but need to
      convert all of the temps to Musk to perform a useful analysis for Elon.
    </p>
    <p>The formula to convert Fahrenheit to Musk is:</p>
    <p>°M = (°F + 32) * (9 / 7)</p>
    <p>
      We are going to be dealing with a lot of data, so I decided to try several
      different ways to map our list from °F to °M and then compare the relative
      performances.
    </p>
    <h2>Test data</h2>
    <p>
      I randomly generated 1,000 integers in a range of values between -1,000
      and 1,000, representing Fahrenheit temperatures.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
import random

random_temps = [random.randint(-1000, 1000) for _ in range(1000)]
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Conversion function</h2>
    <p>
      I abstracted the conversion logic into a helper function
      <code>fahr_to_musk</code> so that we can compare performance with and
      without function calls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using this function will increase readability, but we will have to see how
      it affects execution time.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
def fahr_to_musk(f_temp):
    return (f_temp + 32) * (9 / 7)
    </code></pre>
    <h2>Approach 1 - For loop</h2>
    <p>
      Our main goal is to take an input list of values, modify each element in
      the list with the same logic and then return a new list with the modified
      values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arguably, the simplest way to do this is by iterating through the list of
      values with a for loop, applying our conversion calculation to each one
      and then returning a new list of the modified values (in Musk):
    </p>
    <pre><code>
def map_for_loop():
    mapped_temps = []

    for temp in random_temps:
        musk_temp = (temp + 32) * (9 / 7)
        mapped_temps.append(musk_temp)

    return mapped_temps
    </code></pre>
    <h2>Approach 2 - For loop with function call</h2>
    <p>
      It seems like we could improve the readability of our for loop by
      abstracting the conversion calculation into the helper function
      <code>fahr_to_musk</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This might raise a yellow flag for us since Python tends to have a
      relatively high overhead for function calls, but let's create the function
      and then include it in our performance testing to make sure.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
def map_for_loop_fn_call():
    mapped_temps = []

    for temp in random_temps:
        musk_temp = fahr_to_musk(temp)
        mapped_temps.append(musk_temp)

    return mapped_temps
    </code></pre>
    <h2>Approach 3 - Built-in map() function</h2>
    <p>
      Python's built-in map() function takes in an iterable and a function,
      applies the function to every element and then returns an iterator with
      all of the modified elements.
    </p>
    <code>map(<i>function, iterable, ...</i>)</code>
    <p>
      This seems like a natural choice for what we're wanting to do, so let's
      include it in our tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're passing the function <code>fahr_to_musk</code> to
      <code>map</code> as the first argument and the list of fahrenheit
      temperatures as the iterable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <code>map</code> returns an iterator and we want a list, we'll need
      to create a list from the return iterator.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
def map_built_in():
    mapped_temps = list(map(fahr_to_musk, random_temps))
    return mapped_temps
    </code></pre>
    <h2>Approach 4 - Map built-in with lambda</h2>
    <p>
      In lieu of a named function, <code>map()</code> allows us to pass a lambda
      expression, which is basically just syntactic sugar for an anonymous
      function.
    </p>
    <p>
      It'll be interesting to see how map with lambdas compares to map with a
      named function call, so we include it as one of our approaches.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
def map_built_in_lambda():
    mapped_temps = list(map(lambda t: (t + 32) * (9 / 7), random_temps))
    return mapped_temps
    </code></pre>
    <h2>Approach 5 - List comprehension</h2>
    <p>
      List comprehensions are often an intuitive and readable way to create
      lists from other lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar to the map built-in, they apply specified operations to each
      element in a list or iterable and return the result as a new list.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our first list comprehension, we specify the conversion operations
      inline as opposed to a function call:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
def map_list_comprehension():
    mapped_temps = [((temp + 32) * (9 / 7)) for temp in random_temps]
    return mapped_temps
    </code></pre>
    <h2>Approach 6 - List comprehension with function call</h2>
    <p>
      Finally, let's see what it looks like to simplify our conversion
      calculation in the list comprehension by replacing it with a function
      call:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
def map_list_comprehension_fn_call():
    mapped_temps = [fahr_to_musk(temp) for temp in random_temps]
    return mapped_temps
    </code></pre>
    <h2>Testing</h2>
    <p>Finally, it's time to test out our various map approaches.</p>
    <p>
      We'll use Python's <code>timeit</code> library to test each map function
      one million times with a set of 1,000 random int arguments.
    </p>
    <p>Here is the full code that we will use:</p>
    <pre><code>
import timeit
import random

random_temps = [random.randint(-1000, 1000) for _ in range(1000)]

def fahr_to_musk(f_temp):
    return (f_temp + 32) * (9 / 7)

def map_for_loop():
    mapped_temps = []

    for temp in random_temps:
        musk_temp = (temp + 32) * (9 / 7)
        mapped_temps.append(musk_temp)
    
    return mapped_temps

def map_for_loop_fn_call():
    mapped_temps = []

    for temp in random_temps:
        musk_temp = fahr_to_musk(temp)
        mapped_temps.append(musk_temp)
    
    return mapped_temps

def map_built_in():
    mapped_temps = list(map(fahr_to_musk, random_temps))
    return mapped_temps

def map_built_in_lambda():
    mapped_temps = list(map(lambda t: (t + 32) * (9 / 7), random_temps))
    return mapped_temps

def map_list_comprehension():
    mapped_temps = [((temp + 32) * (9 / 7)) for temp in random_temps]
    return mapped_temps

def map_list_comprehension_fn_call():
    mapped_temps = [fahr_to_musk(temp) for temp in random_temps]
    return mapped_temps

t_map_for_loop = timeit.timeit(map_for_loop)
t_map_for_loop_fn_call = timeit.timeit(map_for_loop_fn_call)
t_map_built_in = timeit.timeit(map_built_in)
t_map_built_in_lambda = timeit.timeit(map_built_in_lambda)
t_map_list_comprehension = timeit.timeit(map_list_comprehension)
t_map_list_comprehension_fn_call = timeit.timeit(map_list_comprehension_fn_call)

print('\n')
print('Execution time (s) with 1,000,000 iterations')
print('------------------------------------')
print(f'map_for_loop: {t_map_for_loop}s')
print(f'map_for_loop_fn_call: {t_map_for_loop_fn_call}s')
print(f'map_built_in: {t_map_built_in}s')
print(f'map_built_in_lambda: {t_map_built_in_lambda}s')
print(f'map_list_comprehension: {t_map_list_comprehension}s')
print(f'map_list_comprehension_fn_call: {t_map_list_comprehension_fn_call}s')
    </code></pre>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
      After running each of our map functions one million times, here are the
      results:
    </p>
    <pre><code>

    </code></pre>
    <p>Interesting!</p>
    <p>
      First of all, notice how much faster the
      <code>map_list_comprehension</code> approach is compared to all others.
    </p>
    <p>
      It beats the next fastest approach (<code>map_built_in</code>) by ~31
      seconds! And it's more than twice as fast as
      <code>map_for_loop_fn_call</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why is it so much faster? Mainly, since
      <i>we're not making any function calls.</i> Function call overhead can
      become very costly over time as we see with these other functions, and we
      are able to significantly reduce execution time by performing all
      operations inline in this case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that the next performant approaches are
      <code>map_built_in</code> and <code>map_built_in_lambda</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The execution times for these approaches are pretty much equivalent. This
      makes sense, because they are both applying a function to every element in
      the list. An anonymous lambda function and the named function seem to
      generate comparable overheads.
    </p>
    <p>
      This suggests that it's up to the developer on whether a lambda or named
      function makes more sense from a readability or maintainability
      perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another interesting observation is how much worse the list comprehension
      performs when include a function call vs. having the operations inline
      (almost twice as bad).
    </p>
    <p>
      If I was optimizing for performance and debating between a named function
      in a list comprehension vs. a named function in the built-in map function,
      I'd choose the map function any day of the week given these results.
    </p>
    <p>
      The for loop approach without a function call had "okay" performance, but
      I don't see a reason to use this approach given how readable and
      performant list comprehensions and built-in map approaches are.
    </p>
    <p>
      I <i>definitely</i> would not use a for loop that calls a function for
      every element when mapping. This by far had the worst performance, lagging
      43 seconds behind the next worst approach.
    </p>
    <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      The major tradeoff when mapping elements to a new list is readability vs.
      performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I was performing simple operations across a reasonable number of
      elements, I would choose list comprehensions with inline operations
      because they are both readable and performant.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I wanted to further improve readability and abstract the function logic
      into an external function, I would probably use the built-in
      <code>map</code> function since it strikes a decent balance between both
      goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      For further experimentation, I'd be interested to see how using bit
      operations would affect the performance, as well as how the relative
      execution times are affected by a larger number of input elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either way, the main takeaway is to experiment and test. This way, we can
      help Elon with his mission of making humans a multi-planetary species, one
      Musk degree at a time.

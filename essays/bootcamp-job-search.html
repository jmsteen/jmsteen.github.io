    <h1>Practical thoughts on the bootcamp grad job search</h1>
    <p>
      Now that I'm on the other side of the job search, I feel like I've gained
      some clarity on what works and what doesn't work when looking for a job as
      a coding bootcamp grad.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been working at Microsoft for almost three months now, and knowing
      what the actual work looks like helps me better understand what I did well
      and what I could have done better during my job search.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not speaking here on behalf of Microsoft, and nothing I write here is
      a result of inside knowledge of how to evaluate candidates. I'm simply
      connecting some dots from when I was looking for a job just 5 months ago
      to what I know now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since COVID-19 has created such a tough environment for anyone to find
      their first engineering job, not to mention bootcamp grads, I'd love to
      offer some thoughts on how you might be able to gain an edge and increase
      your likelihood of getting a job.
    </p>

    <h2>Let's talk about LinkedIn</h2>
    <p>
      LinkedIn in crucial for your search, but looking like every other bootcamp
      grad won't do you any favors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try looking through your feed on LinkedIn. Can you spot the bootcamp
      grads?
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually, their headlines all look the same. Packed full of specific
      technologies in order to take advantage of keywords in order for
      recruiters to find them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did this too. On paper it makes sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what actually happens is that you create an easy filter for everyone
      to know that you're a bootcamp grad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I need to say, I was a bootcamp grad too. There's nothing wrong with
      being a bootcamp grad. I wish there were more bootcamp grads!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUT, bootcamp grads don't have the best reputation with recruiters and
      hiring managers when being evaluated by jobs. We can say this is sad or
      unfair or whatever, but unfortunately it's true.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, what you really want is to
      <i>remind people of competent, professional software engineers.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      You want people to look at your profile and think "Oh, this looks like the
      candidate that the team hired a few months ago" or "This looks like that
      Google candidate that was super impressive last week."
    </p>
    <p>
      If you look at the LinkedIn profiles of software engineers currently
      working at well-respected companies, their profiles are usually fairly
      sparse, concise and succinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most often, their LinkedIn headline will simply say "Software Engineer at
      Google".
    </p>
    <p>
      This conciseness signals confidence. They don't need to showcase all of
      technologies they know.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, they realize that specific technologies, while important, take a
      distant backseat to creating real, measurable impact through their work
      and understanding the underlying engineering principles of those
      technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can still take advantage of keywords in your About, Experience and
      Skills section on LinkedIn, but my personal opinion is that your headline
      (which is the first thing people see when deciding whether to click on
      your profile) should remind people of other professional, competent
      engineers.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a bootcamp grad, "Software Engineer", "Full-stack Software Developer"
      or "Frontend Software Engineer" are all good examples of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would also avoid having things like "Looking for opportunities" in your
      headline.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all people see about you is that you're "looking for opportunities",
      you're not really matching their heuristic for "experienced, professional
      software engineer", even though you very well may be one.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lot of first-time job seekers use "looking for opportunities" in their
      headlines, while many experienced engineers instead focus on direct
      outreach or their network to communicate that they're looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      You want to occupy the same mental space as the latter in HM and
      recruiters' minds.
    </p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>I'll be honest, the projects on my resume were relatively basic.</p>
    <p>
      I took them very seriously and worked hard to make them work and look
      good, but I wasn't impressing anyone at Microsoft with my genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it's important that I had them. Projects will be your technical
      experience when you interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is another way to gain an edge and overcome the bootcamp stigma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most bootcamp projects are some small variation of the same basic thing. A
      cutely-named crud app clone using the latest JavaScript framework with
      basic working functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that's fine! But it could be better. You will be evaluated against
      computer science grads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for them, their education will offset some of their lack of
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      For you, you'll have to signal to recruiters and HMs that you have the
      same level of technical competency as a computer science grad as it
      relates to the job you're interviewing for, without the stamp of
      credibility of a traditional education.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your projects are a great way to showcase that and have you stand out
      compared to the sea of simple crud apps they see on hundreds or thousands
      of resumes per position.
    </p>
    <p>How do you do this? You do something technically hard.</p>
    <p>
      If you have one technically difficult thing per project you can talk
      about, you're already far ahead of most candidates.
    </p>
    <p>
      What's an example? If you're hoping to work at a big tech company like
      Google or Microsoft, one idea is to think of a way to incorporate advanced
      data structures or algorithms into your project to measurably improve
      performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many roles at these companies, you will actually be using advanced
      data structures and algorithms on the job to efficiently handle data and
      ensure optimal performance at scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe you use bitwise operations in an interesting way to speed something
      up in your project or use an advanced sorting algorithm to reduce time
      complexity for an important feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      This particular example tells your interviewer a few things.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, you have the same or higher grasp of data structures and algorithms
      than the typical computer science grad, which gives you credibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, you know how to think algorithmically and technically in order to
      optimize performance. In other words, you're technically competent and
      would add value to the team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third, it signals that you have a genuine interest in software engineering
      and aren't just doing the project your bootcamp made you do in order to
      get a job.
    </p>
    <p>Basically, it makes you look legit.</p>
    <h2>Level up your engineering knowledge</h2>
    <p>
      The most important thing you can do to earn that first great job is to
      <strong
        >actually focus on becoming an excellent software engineer.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      We've talked a lot about signaling competency, but at the end of the way
      it's most important to actually <strong>be</strong> competent as it
      relates to the position you're applying for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember, you're being evaluated against candidates with CS degrees from
      Stanford. You're expected to know the same fundamental computer science
      knowledge that's relevant to the job.
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as interviews go, this mostly relates to data structures and
      algorithms since most interviews focus on these types of problems to
      evaluate candidates.
    </p>
    <p>
      But depending on the job, you might also be asked about bit operations,
      concurrency, specifics of memory allocation and low-level system topics
      like CPU caches, threads, and system calls.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's up to you to fill in the relevant gaps after the bootcamp to get that
      job you're hoping for.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most cases, going deep on data structures and algorithms will get you
      80-90% of the way there.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I know from experience that there are many extremely smart and
      hard-working bootcamp grads that would do an amazing job at any of these
      big tech companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      My hope is that by overcoming some of bias we face as bootcamp grads, you
      will have a much better shot at letting your skills shine through.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are every bit as a capable of rocking these tech interviews and
      getting that job as a computer science grad, so I hope this is helpful in
      thinking of some ideas to get there faster.

    <h1>Going back to school</h1>

      <p>
        I’m a day shy of turning 30 and a lot of people I know are going back to
        school after having graduated college some 7 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        In many cases it’s great. I went back to “school” by doing this 6-month
        programming bootcamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thing is, what we should know by now is what we didn’t know when we
        went to college.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mainly, that going to school is a dangerous thing because it gives you
        false security.
      </p>
      <p>Graduating with a 4.0 will not do anything for your career.</p>
      <p><em>Learning</em> will.</p>
      <p>
        And more specifically,

        as Seth Godin defines it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We need to learn to connect the things we’re learning to what will be
        valuable to another person we care about and understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, we get paid by being a piece of the value chain for an end
        consumer.
      </p>
      <p>
        We get to decide how close to the consumer we are in that chain, but
        regardless, that’s our goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can be lulled into competing against our classmates or counting on
        the prestige of our program, but ultimately our goal should be to learn,
        teach and contribute.

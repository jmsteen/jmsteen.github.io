    <h1>A little bit about bits</h1>
    <p>
      Coding bootcamps and self-study programs are usually light on bits and
      binary operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      It makes sense. You have limited time, and most of the time there is
      enough abstraction to effectively program and build things without needing
      to get to the level of the bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this gap in knowledge can make a big difference in your coding
      interviews as well as your job performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Computer science grads learn all about bits and binary operations and your
      understanding or lack thereof in this area can be used as a signal to
      recruiters, interviewers and your boss about the depth of your computer
      science knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plus, depending on your role, bits can play an important role in the
      software you develop. They are used to optimize memory and performance in
      numerous ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll get into the weeds on bits here in this article, but it's crucial to
      understand that bits are important for passing your coding interviews,
      performing well on the job and simply being a better, more competent
      software engineer.
    </p>
    <h2>The fundamentals</h2>
    <h3>What are bits?</h3>
    <p>
      A <strong>bit</strong> (aka "binary digit") is the most basic unit of
      storage in a computer. It only has two possible states. Most commonly, we
      represent these states as either 0 or 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also represent them as true/false, off/on and so on, but let's
      stick with 0s and 1s to align with the most common bit terminology.
    </p>
    <p>
      All software boils down to bits. Every image, software application and
      piece of data in your computer is stored only in 0s and 1s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the hood, there is a physical mechanism in the computer that changes
      between the two states.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are various ways of physically storing bits, but generally bits are
      implemented through microscopic pieces of hardware called transistors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Transistors act like switches and can be turned on (1) or off (0)
      depending on the amount of voltage being passed through them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty cool right?
    </p>
    <h3>Bytes</h3>
    <p>
      It gets a little unwieldy to talk about storage in terms of individual
      bits. It's easier to think in terms of collections of bits, the smallest
      of which is called a byte.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <strong>byte</strong> is merely a contiguous series of 8 bits. In most
      computers, a byte is the smallest <i>addressable</i> unit of storage in a
      computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      By addressable, I mean it's the smallest unit of memory that has an
      <strong>address</strong> the Central Processing Unit (CPU) can use to
      locate data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CPU uses this address when it needs to perform any kind of operation
      for this particular byte. In other words, it's how the computer finds
      stuff the that you stored in a sea of bits.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm simplifying a tad (we can get into encoding in a different post), but
      a byte can hold a single character like "a" or "B".
    </p>
    <p>
      We can use a byte to store several different patterns of bits that
      represent various values.
    </p>
    <h3>Base-2 Number System</h3>
    <p>
      To understand how bytes are used to represent values through bits, you
      have to understand how the base-2 number system works.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're used to a base-10 number system. In the most basic sense, this means
      that each digit of a number is multiplied by a certain power of 10,
      depending on its position.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, let's take 254.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>5</td>
          <td>4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2 * 10<sup>2</sup></td>
          <td>5 * 10<sup>1</sup></td>
          <td>4 * 10<sup>0</sup></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      The rightmost digit is often called the least significant digit (LSD)

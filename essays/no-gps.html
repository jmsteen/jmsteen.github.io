        I’ve always wanted a map. Something to tell me exactly how to do what I
        want to do, and do it right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, not always. When I was a kid I made movies. And comedy skits. And
        drawings. I don’t remember looking for a map. I remember having fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        But when I got older, I wanted a map. I felt the pressure first in
        school, because there is definitely a right way to do things in school.
      </p>
      <p>
        Play the game. Get good grades. Get into a good college. Get a shot of
        having a stable career.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then it crept into my spirituality. Go to church X times/week. Pray X
        times/day, in this particular way. I became kind of spiritually OCD and
        it sucked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I knew it was bad when it even crept into my dating life. I was
        constantly checking in with friends and reading dating advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should I say this? That? How often should I reach out? Which date should
        I hold hands? When should I make it official?
      </p>
      <p>I was looking for right answers.</p>
      <p>But there weren’t any right answers.</p>
      <p>
        I even did the same thing in a part of my life that should have been
        totally free and creative: my music production.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is this the right drum sample? Will it work for what’s on-trend right
        now? What about the right plug-in? Should I master myself or hire out?
        Which mastering engineer?
      </p>
      <p>
        I got so map-oriented that I literally had to tape this on my desk to
        remind myself to actually enjoy what I was doing:
      </p>
      <img src="../images/what-will-i-love-the-most.jpg" alt="" width="300px" />
      <p>
        Then I started to realize that A) this was making me incredibly unhappy
        and B) people didn’t know the answers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, they thought they knew the answers, but would always contradict
        each other. And it’s hard to actually validate their advice. It might
        have worked for them (or not), but that doesn’t mean it will work for
        me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m starting to learn, however, that the most important things in life
        don’t have right answers. There is no map. There may be models,
        analogies, and metaphors, but there is no how-to guide.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I think realizing that fact alone is one of the most freeing things
        in life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Which career should I choose? There is no right answer. And please for
        your own sake don’t outsource that question to people around you. Only
        you can answer it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like only you can answer whether or not to marry that person,
        initiate in that relationship or give to that person you know needs
        help.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are all looking for people who make decisions that are interesting,
        authentic and well-intentioned. We want innovators, risk-takers and
        those who want to move things forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        We get scared to do it ourselves because we might fail, but we love when
        others take the chance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then after they succeed we look up to them as successes, role models and
        those far above us in life.
      </p>
      <p>
        But they’re just people who decided, “Hey, I’m going to choose this path
        because I think it’s exciting, it matters to me and it may help someone
        else. Who knows how it will end up.”
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s okay if it doesn’t work. Maybe we should be more “explorers” than
        drivers following a GPS anyway.

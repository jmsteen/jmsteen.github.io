    <h1>What I do and don't miss about being a CPA</h1>

      <p>I haven’t worked at an accounting firm in over three years.</p>
      <p>
        This morning, I was looking back at my past life as an accountant and
        wondering, do I miss anything about that job?
      </p>
      <p>And what don’t I miss?</p>
      <h2>What I don’t miss</h2>
      <p>I don’t miss…</p>
      <p>the long, forced hours,</p>
      <p>working on subject matter I didn’t care about,</p>
      <p>putting my creativity aside,</p>
      <p>corporate politics that I didn’t care about,</p>
      <p>
        a structure that prevented utilization of my full potential and skill
        set,
      </p>
      <p>no room for scary experimentation,</p>
      <p>the focus on compliance,</p>
      <p>worrying about billable hours,</p>
      <p>not working towards something that creates an exciting future,</p>
      <p>the hierarchical power dynamics,</p>
      <p>difficult clients,</p>
      <p>wishing I was doing something else.</p>
      <h2>What I do miss</h2>
      <p>
        Actually, slight rephrase. This is what I <em>value</em> from my
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some things I actually miss, like the people. Others I simply value, but
        wouldn’t necessarily want to repeat.
      </p>
      <p>I miss / value…</p>
      <p>Many of my coworkers and bosses,</p>
      <p>getting to experience environments of different businesses,</p>
      <p>gaining accounting expertise to apply any future business I start,</p>
      <p>learning what it means to act like a professional,</p>
      <p>the emphasis on accuracy, details and excellence,</p>
      <p>learning how to execute well under pressure,</p>
      <p>
        understanding how finances of a variety of businesses are structured,
      </p>
      <p>working as part of a team,</p>
      <p>friendships.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Overall, I’m grateful for what accounting has taught me about what I
        like and don’t like.
      </p>
      <p>
        I always viewed accounting as a temporary bridge to where I wanted to
        go, which was somewhere entrepreneurial, creative, exciting and near the
        edge.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never really fit in with the profession, and if you would have asked
        me during or right after I left, I would be tempted to write off (no pun
        intended) an unfair portion of my experience as little to no value.
      </p>
      <p>
        But looking back, it seems like there was more value in my brief time as
        an accountant than I thought.

      <p>
        If you feel like you’re getting blocked from what you want by some
        unfair system (group of people) that&nbsp;doesn’t want you, you can….
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fight even harder to be accepted by them</li>
        <li>Settle for the next best thing</li>
        <li>Change what you want</li>
        <li>
          Complain loudly enough about the system to try to change their minds
        </li>
        <li>
          Decide to go after what you really wanted in the first place, whether
          or not they want to go there with you
        </li>
        <li>Make your own system, one that you believe in</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Which sound most appealing?</p>

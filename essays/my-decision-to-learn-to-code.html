      <h1>Why I'm learning to code now</h1>
      <small>July 6, 2019</small>
      <p>
        After 29 years of no computer programming, I’ve decided that now is the
        time to learn how to code.
      </p>
      <p>
        A friend of mine (<a
          href="https://noeldemartin.com/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >Noel</a
        >) thought it might be interesting to discuss my journey from business
        into tech, and I thought so too.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Why</h2>
      <p>
        I write a lot on here about creativity, making things and the future of
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that to figure out what the future of work is, you have to find
        out where future value lies.
      </p>
      <p>
        What will people care about 10, 20, 40 years from now? And what will be
        valuable enough to pay for?
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s increasingly obvious that you cannot have this conversation without
        mentioning how big of a role technology will play.
      </p>
      <p>No matter what field you’re in, tech will be a part of it.</p>
      <p>
        So, a significant reason that I’m learning to code now is that I want to
        be part of this change, not just figure out how to work around it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, I’m passionate about helping other people find fulfilling
        work as the world changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more perspective I have on how technology is developing, the better
        I can accomplish that goal.
      </p>
      <p>Also, my reason is kind of selfish.</p>
      <p>
        I’ve been obsessed with startups, entrepreneurship and people who start
        their own business, because that’s my goal some day as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the more people I listened to, the more I realized that software and
        technology is an awesome gateway for people to deliver value to an
        audience for minimal cost.
      </p>
      <p>It’s scalable, sustainably valuable and just plain interesting.</p>
      <p>
        It’s also a great way to find work that’s stimulating and rewarding.
      </p>
      <p>All in all, I decided to finally learn how to code because:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          &nbsp;I was sick of using and admiring technology (and entrepreneurs
          who made it) while not having a clue how to build it.
        </li>
        <li>
          I wanted to feel empowered to embrace the change that technology will
          bring to the future and actually have a say in that change.
        </li>
        <li>
          I wanted an avenue to find work that is interesting, challenging,
          valuable and that improves other areas of my life.
        </li>
        <li>
          I wanted to have the ability to build software and technology for
          whatever project, business or passion I have down the road.
        </li>
        <li>
          I wanted to utilize technology and my own career change to help others
          who are struggling with their careers find engaging and satisfying
          work.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>How</h2>
      <p>
        My initial avenue for getting into tech and learning how to code is
        through
        <a
          href="https://www.appacademy.io/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >App Academy</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        App Academy (a/A) is a software engineering bootcamp that basically
        trains you how to be job-ready as an engineer in 6 months. It’s pretty
        intense.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know, however, that doing a bootcamp like this will not be sufficient
        for being a great engineer. But it’s a hell of a start.
      </p>
      <p>
        I plan to give the next 6 months my full focus in order to take
        advantage of the cohort I’m in, the instructors and the program as much
        as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ll probably share several updates about how the program is going, what
        my experience was and eventually, what my outcome was in the program.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know this will be helpful to others considering doing a bootcamp in
        the future.
      </p>
      <p>Besides a/A, I plan to build, build, build.</p>
      <p>I don’t just want to pass curriculum written for me.</p>
      <p>
        I want to learn by solving interesting problems, making things that
        excite me and turning my newfound knowledge into a tool to become even
        more curious about what I don’t know.
      </p>
      <h2>How it feels</h2>
      <p>
        I’ll be honest. I’m about to turn 30 next month at the time of this
        post, and I’m a little self-conscious about entering into a field
        colored with stereotypes of ever-younger programmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worry sometimes if there will be an age bias when I’m applying to
        companies that I want to work for.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder if I’ll be able to keep up and perform as well as someone in
        their early 20’s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, I fear that starting “late” like I am now will cripple my
        prospects of having the kind of success in my career that I desire.
      </p>
      <p>This is the dark side of getting into tech at 30.</p>
      <p>But, I also feel excited.</p>
      <p>I don’t believe that I’ll actually be worse off because of my age.</p>
      <p>
        I’m really excited to bring everything I have to the table and combine
        it with the skills I’ll learn as a programmer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve made performed and produced music, written hundreds of blog posts,
        worked at Big 4 accounting firms, made a really cool podcast, been a
        Digital Marketing Manager, built and tested out an ecommerce store,
        failed a lot, had some wins and learned a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of this experience will undoubtedly put me in a position to have a
        unique combination of skills and perspective that allows me to create a
        very specific value for whoever I’m serving.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m also really looking forward to the challenge of learning something
        new and doing my best in an area where I am initially incompetent.
      </p>
      <p>
        It feels like an adventure. There’s so much possibility of what I can
        build, how I can contribute and the life that this may allow me to live.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tech is ever-growing and ever-changing, so there is always something new
        and intriguing to explore.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite my doubts, fears and worries, overall I am confident, excited
        and hopeful to see what I can do, who I can contribute to and what I can
        build.

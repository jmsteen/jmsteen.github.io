    <h1>What I'm up to now</h1>
    <h2>Microsoft</h2>
    <p>
      After an intense 9-month period transitioning my career into software
      engineering, I finally landed a job. I'm working at Microsoft in Austin
      delivering features for the SQL Server and SQL Azure products.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm really loving my job. It's really interesting work, I'm learning a
      hell of a lot, and I have a great boss. I'm lucky.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a "back end" role, and it's been fascinating learning about how the
      SQL engine works and how such a mammoth of a codebase was built and
      operates.
    </p>
    <h2>Moved to Austin</h2>
    <p>
      While attending the coding bootcamp (App Academy) I went through, I was
      living in Houston. When I got the job at Microsoft, I pretty quickly moved
      to Austin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Austin is a pretty ideal city for most things besides the heat and lack of
      geographical draws like ocean or mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people, food, vibe and culture is great. I'm really enjoying it.
    </p>
    <h2>Thinking about projects</h2>
    <p>
      Now that I have a job, I'm thinking about what interesting projects I can
      start working on during the weekends.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm thinking about building a personal finance app for myself to help
      project my cash flow and keep track of my expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also thinking about starting to create computer science curriculum for
      people who graduated from coding bootcamps.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a lot of topics that bootcamps simply don't have time to teach,
      and I think it would be fun to assimilate core concepts for junior
      engineers that could help them land better jobs.
